# PySnake
Snake in Python created for embedding in a website. 

The game was originally developed using turtle graphics. The project was part of the 100 Days of Python course on Udemy by Dr. Angela Yu. 
The game has been modified to use the Pygame library for better performance and graphics within a web browser.
