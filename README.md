# PySnake
Snake in Python created for embedding in a website. 

The project was part of the 100 Days of Python course on Udemy by Dr. Angela Yu.

The game was originally developed using turtle graphics. 
I have modified the game to use the Pygame library for better performance and graphics within a web browser.
